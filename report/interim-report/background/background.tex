\section{Background}

This section introduces some technical background which will likely be required as part of the project. It includes an introduction to neural networks and CNNs, a comparison of some existing object tracking and object detection algorithms and a discussion on knowledge representation and reasoning and symbolic rule learning.

\subsection{Deep Learning}

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a very successful algorithm for machine learning; deep learning has been used to beat records in tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition and language translation\cite{deep-learning-intro}. Many different architectures have been proposed to solve various tasks, these architectures include convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are designed to process data that come in the form of multiple arrays\cite{deep-learning-intro}, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are designed to process sequences of arbitrary length\cite{def:rnn}. The following section gives a brief introduction to CNNs.
