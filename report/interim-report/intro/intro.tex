\section{Introduction}

Writing algorithms which can answer questions on pictures or videos with a high level of accuracy and generality has been a goal of researchers in the AI community for many years. Recently, a lot of progress has been made in this area; with advances in neural network models and the production of larger datasets allowing reseachers to significantly improve accuracy on question answering models.

Formally, Visual Question Answering (VQA)\cite{2017vqa}. is a task where, given an image and a question posed in natural language about the image, a model is required to produce an open-ended answer to the question. Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a related task where a model is given a video (mulitple images in sequence) and a question. These questions can be related to a single frame of the video, effectiively making VideoQA a superset of the VQA task.
